A simple SCM (Source Control Management) branching strategy could involve the following branches:

1. `main` or `master` branch: This branch represents the production-ready code. Only code that has passed all tests and reviews should be merged into this branch. The code in this branch should always be deployable.

2. `develop` branch: This branch represents the latest development changes that are not yet ready for production. All developers should work on their features and bug fixes in this branch. It should only be merged into the `main` branch after thorough testing and code review.

3. `feature` branches: These branches are created by developers for each new feature they are working on. The branch should be named after the feature being developed, such as `feature/new-login-page`. Once the feature is complete, the branch should be merged into the `develop` branch.

4. `release` branches: These branches are created when the `develop` branch is nearing a release. All bug fixes and small feature changes should be made in this branch. Once the release is ready, the branch should be merged into both the `main` and `develop` branches.

5. `hotfix` branches: These branches are created when a critical bug is discovered in the `main` branch that must be fixed immediately. A hotfix branch should be created from the `main` branch and named after the bug, such as `hotfix/missing-data`. Once the bug is fixed, the branch should be merged into both the `main` and `develop` branches.

This branching strategy follows a linear flow from development to production, with feature branches being merged into the `develop` branch, `release` branches being merged into both the `main` and `develop` branches, and `hotfix` branches being merged into both the `main` and `develop` branches as well. This strategy ensures that code is thoroughly tested and reviewed before it is merged into the `main` branch, and that any critical issues can be fixed quickly without disrupting the development process.
